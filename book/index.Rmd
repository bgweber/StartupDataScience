# Prerequisites
# The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:
# Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
# To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): 
# <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
